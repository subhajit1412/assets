My research interests are on Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Currently, I am working on applying deep learning techniques for predicting structural integrity of bridges and roads from raw images and videos. Personally, I am also working on learning end-to-end Fully Convolutional Networks for solving low level vision tasks like image restoration.
